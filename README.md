# AutoSales EDA and RFM-Analysis
## About
Explored automotive sales data through an analysis, uncovering patterns in sales, customer behavior, and product performance. The project utilizes SQL queries for data cleaning and analysis. Implemented RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to segment and understand customer behavior.

- Recency: The time since a consumer last made a purchase.
- Frequency: How frequently a customer purchases goods from your store.
- Monetary value: A customer's total spending with your brand.
